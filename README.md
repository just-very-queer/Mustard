# Mustard - A Swift-based Mastodon Client

Mustard is an iOS application designed to interact with the Mastodon social network. It allows users to view timelines, post statuses, interact with posts, and explore trending content.

## Features (Inferred from Codebase)
*   Browse home timeline and trending posts.
*   Post statuses, reply to posts.
*   Favourite and reblog posts.
*   Search for content, users, and hashtags.
*   View user profiles and their posts.
*   Support for multiple Mastodon instances.
*   Caching of data for offline access and performance.
*   Authentication via OAuth.

## Building and Running
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `Mustard.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3.  Select the "Mustard" scheme and an appropriate simulator or device.
4.  Build and run the application.

*(Note: Ensure you have a compatible version of Xcode installed that supports Swift 5 and the iOS SDK version targeted by the project.)*

## Key Technologies Used
*   **SwiftUI:** For the user interface.
*   **SwiftData:** For local data persistence (e.g., caching posts, user accounts).
*   **Combine:** For handling asynchronous events and data flows.
*   **Mastodon API:** Interaction with Mastodon instances is done via their public API.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories:
*   `Models/`: Contains data models like `Post`, `User`, `Account`.
*   `Services/`: Houses logic for interacting with the Mastodon API (`MastodonAPIService`, `TimelineService`, `SearchService`, etc.) and other services like caching (`CacheService`).
*   `ViewModels/`: Contains view models that prepare and manage data for the views.
*   `Views/`: Contains the SwiftUI views that make up the user interface.
*   `Mustard/`: Main application entry point and core application files.
*   `Effects/`, `Utilities/`: Helper code and custom UI components/modifiers.
